Time taken: 4 Hours and 45 minutes
### How to test
To test it on you android smartphone device, download the "VRProject1.apk" located inside the "Build" folder.

To test it inside your unity editor, download the "Assets" and the "ProjectSettings" folders. Also get [Google VR SDK](https://github.com/googlevr/gvr-unity-sdk) and place it inside your project.

### Things I learned:
* Adding 3D models to a scene
* Moving, scaling, and rotating 3D models
* Deploying to your Cardboard Viewer
* Creating materials and assigning textures
* Creating animations and triggering them
* Creating lights and baking them
* Optimizing a scene for top performance

Likes: The final result was satisfying made me almost cry

Chanllenges: There were a lot of challeneges that I encountered:
* First of all, the VR functionalities. I tried following the instructions creating 2 cameras with LSD but there was an error asking me to add GRViewerMain. After adding the prefab, there were 4 cameras in the scene and to resolve it, I went to the first project to understand what's going on
* Second challenge was the "Globe" because all the cameras disappeared when i tried to run when i had 4 cameras in the scene but was later resolved when I looked at the first project.
* Third one was the trying to build a beautiful scene with minimal props. Also, some object's pivot such as the microwave was a bit off which it more challenging.
* Last thing was adding a background city music like.
